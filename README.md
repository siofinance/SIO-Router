# About SIO
[SIO](https://sio.finance/) is a smart wallet that provides users with an extremely gas-optimized router, enabling them to send or multi-send ETH, as well as swap or multi-swap tokens in the same transaction. In addition, SIO assists developers in managing a token's smart contract after deployment by loading the contract's functions and helping them call specific functions as needed.
